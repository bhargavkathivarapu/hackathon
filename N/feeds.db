ET GBS: Road sector to create 50 lakh jobs in 3 years, says Gadkari
The  roads sector will create more than 50 lakh  jobs in the country in the next three years, road transport and highways ministry minister  Nitin Gadkari said at the summit. The ministry will complete the work of awarding road contracts worth Rs 5 lakh crore in the next three years, Gadkari said.  "We have already awarded road contracts worth Rs 1.5 lakh crore," he said. Rs 1 crore of investment in roads gives jobs to 800 people, he said, citing a World Bank report. "Through my ministry, I will give jobs to 50 lakh people and will add 2% to the GDP. It will give a boost to the steel and cement industry as well," he said.  The government has a target of increasing the country's road length to 1.5 lakh km from the existing 96,000 km in the next four years. Gadkari said he was hopeful that the finance minister would increase the allocation to the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana in the upcoming Budget. "It doesn't come under my ministry but I'm still convincing the prime minister and finance minister that this scheme needs more money," he said.  Gadkari said his ministry will achieve targets well in advance. He said that his ministry was constructing 18 km of road every day and the aim was to take this to 30 km by March. He also said that his ministry wants to turn 289 lighthouses and 1,300 islands into tourism hubs. The shipping ministry has already received bids from the private sector for 70 lighthouses.  Gadkari said he was hopeful of getting the inland waterways and roads safety bills passed. "I haven't been able to get the roads safety bill (approved) and it's a black spot on my ministry," he said.  Gadkari is optimistic that, with the current approach, his ministry will be able to clear about 15 pending projects worth Rs 25,000-30,000 crore in the next 15 days, thus paving the way for all projects to move ahead after being stuck for a long time.

Is online ticketing aggregator BookMyShow an ecomm model like no other?
The  G7 multiplex in the suburb of Bandra in Mumbai is not really a multiplex. Built next to the Western Railway tracks, between the Bandra and Khar Road stations, it's actually a group of seven theatres, with separate box offices. When in Bandra, don't look for G7, if you want to find it. Instead ask for Gaiety-Galaxy and you will be easily directed to a lane off Swami Vivekananda Road.  All the seven theatres have names starting with the letter G (The other five are Gem, Gemini, Glamour, Gossip and Grace). Inside, the complex is a maze with narrow stairways leading to the theatres that were built in the early '70s, Gaiety and Galaxy being the bigger ones.  The G7 theatres were also a black marketer's paradise. For popular shows, more tickets are sold by touts on the pavements outside at a premium than at the counters. So, when  BookMyShow (BMS), an online ticketing aggregator for movie and events, announced in mid-January that it had signed up G7, it was indeed a surprise.            Behind the Glitz Bringing G7 onboard is probably a bigger achievement for  BMS than a deal signed with  PVR Cinemas back in 2013. PVR had been the last major  multiplex chain to not offer its tickets on the BMS platform. The 2013 deal between the two guaranteed Rs 1,000 crore of business for PVR Cinemas in five years.  G7 on the other hand is manifestation of a conviction of the BMS management that there is growth lurking in the less glitzy and often dusty avenues of Indian cinema.  In January 2016, along with G7, BMS also announced the coming on board of Maratha Mandir, the iconic 1,000-seater single screen theatre near central Mumbai which still runs a daily 11:30 am show of  Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge.  The tickets for DDLJ are priced as low as Rs 15. The highest price at G7 or Maratha Mandir on any regular day (for a movie like Airlift) hovers around Rs 100. BMS typically charges a fee of 10-30% on tickets from the buyers. For the Rs 15 ticket at Maratha Mandir it charges Rs 3. Multiplexes like PVR are in a different league with premium offerings sometimes commanding more than Rs 500 a ticket.  In spite of the low prices outside multiplexes, growth for BMS hinges less on multiplexes and more on single-screen and traditional cinemas. And not just in big cities but more and more in the hinterland. BMS today has 2,500 screens on its portal and mobile app, with all major multiplexes on board. India on the other hand has around 12,000 screens of which only 2,000 are multiplexes.  As a growth avenue it does not seem a lucrative path. First, ticket values and therefore margins are even lower and as one goes into tier II and tier III cities, online payment becomes a problem.  Second, movie ticket pricing is a highly regulated regime with different rules for different states, and ticket pricing has to be announced in advance to the authorities. BMS, on top of that, is already a virtual monopoly in the Indian market.  All other significant competitors in movie ticket booking that accounts for more than 60% of its revenues (88% by volume) have either folded up or have been acquired (in 2013 BMS acquired Chennai based online movieticket seller TicketGreen).  KyaZoonga, which claims to be India's first online movie tickets aggregator, having started selling in April 2007, has over the years moved away from movie tickets and focused on higher-margin sports and other live events, particularly exclusive partnerships.             "The pressure on the margins in movie tickets did not make sense. Not only were multiplexes not paying us to sell their tickets, they also wanted a share of the convenience fee," says Neetu Bhatia, cofounder, Kya-Zoonga. The portal, which was the exclusive ticketing partner for the 2011 Cricket World Cup, lost the bid to sell tickets to this's year's Rio Olympics to CTS Eventim, a German company.          In 2014-15, the first full year with PVR on board, BMS recorded revenues of Rs 127.6 crore, a growth of 51%. Although the company finished the year in the red, with a net loss of Rs 13.5 crore, it was the second consecutive year of 50% plus growth for the company. In June 2014, SAIF Partners, a private equity firm, valued the company at Rs 1,000 crore when it invested Rs 150 crore; that amount has till date been largely untouched. Ashish Hemrajani, Parikshit Dar and Rajesh Balpande founded Bigtree Entertainment, the company that owns BMS, in 1999 after the trio took a vacation in South Africa. Bigtree started by selling a ticketing software called Vista made by a New Zealand-based company to multiplexes that were coming up at the time.  (Even today Bigtree manages PVR Cinemas' online ticket booking portal.) Then, in 2007, after a major investment by Network18, BMS was launched. "If you look at us today, the things we do are virtually the same that we were doing a decade back," says Hemrajani. Sticking to the core is the company's secret sauce, insists Hemrajani, something that ensured they survived a couple of downturns.  Hemrajani is clear that he is not going to offer discounts in the hunt for valuations. He remembers very well the days in 2001-02 when the company had to let go of staff, was reduced to six people and did not have money to even buy air tickets to Delhi.  And even as the likes of Paytm, a payment wallet and an  ecommerce marketplace with permission to launch a payment bank, has declared its intention to offer discounted tickets for movies, Hemrajani insists that BMS has no plans to convert its own closed-loop wallet into anything else to compete.  Not Really Ecommerce? "If your business model is to gather unique identities and phone numbers and build up a list that you can sell, you might as well stand on the street and offer Rs 100 for every person willing to share his number. You will find many takers, but we are not in this game," Hemrajani says. "We live and die by the value we provide to our users."  Hemrajani and Dar met ET Magazine in a meeting room designed like an open air theatre at the BMS office in Andheri in suburban Mumbai. The balcony outside often doubles up as a bigger meeting space and a strategically-placed bicycle decorated with LED lights adds to the optics. The lobby chairs all seem to be lifted out of a cinema and the walls are actually ripped out of large transport containers.              BMS has around four containers that have been fabricated to work as entry gates to events with turnstiles, and transports them on large trailer trucks whenever it is managing an event. Services like managing entry to large events and managing access for security personnel are some of the alternative revenue streams, as are ticket sale for events, plays and some of the Indian Premier League franchisees. (It recently sold Filmfare awards tickets, offering a chance to buyers to rub shoulders with stars). Sreedhar Prasad, partner and head of ecommerce at KPMG, feels all this is not enough for BMS to jump into the big league of Indian ecommerce. "In fact they are not really an ecommerce company. They have no control over the inventory and have no way of influencing sales," says Prasad. He explains that a Flipkart or a Snapdeal clocks revenues from at least seven or eight different streams, including vendor commission, logistics commission, payment commission and advertising.  "There is no evidence of any transformational thinking at BMS. Why can't they tie up with Uber and Ola and offer a ride to the cinema and a ride back home along with the ticket?" Prasad asks. He further suggests that there can be many ways of pushing sales like location specific inputs. "If I am going past a cinema or an event venue I could get an update from BMS telling me that there are unsold tickets available."  Offering a little extra to users is something BMS is beginning to do. The website for instance now allows users to look for events that are happening in and around the city, or even group events for kids in a single place. It has also created a new service for ratings of movies and urges actual ticket buyers to rate a movie. The ratings have surprised the team (see Movie Ratings) and good ratings especially for regional flicks have spurred on distributors to book more screens for some of them.

The ratings have surprised the team (see Movie Ratings) and good ratings especially for regional flicks have spurred on distributors to book more screens for some of them.  Numbers Game Hemrajani insists that the growth strategy would be more vertical than horizontal; moving deeper into the country and finding more screens and at the same time looking for openings into markets abroad. The company already has a presence in New Zealand as an extension of Bigtree's earlier relationship and is looking at a possible entry into Indonesia, which is a market similar to India, says Hemrajani. There is also a merchandise play in the offing and the website may sell products built around a movie's theme or characters. It recently sold 600 T-shirts around the movie Star Wars: The Force Awakens.  However, the question raised by Prasad of KPMG finds an echo in the numbers of BMS and Bigtree Entertainment. For 2013-14, the three ecommerce majors of India, Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal, recorded revenues of Rs 179 crore, Rs 168 crore and Rs 154 crore respectively, as per data from Techcircle, an entrepreneurship and technology startup portal; and all of them at the same point were incurring losses that were much more than their revenues. In 2014-15, the losses grew manifold, becoming less of an indicator of the profitability of the business and more of the quantum of discounts are being doled out. The current year will see another humongous growth in losses.  On the other hand Bigtree's 2014-15 revenues at Rs 127.6 crore are similar to the revenue of the big three in 2013-14, but its loss of only Rs 13.5 crore indicates that company is playing in a different and smaller league. Its value of ticket sales (around Rs 1,000 crore) also cannot be compared to the gross merchandise value of the ecommerce biggies. Hemrajani says: "We can be profitable very quickly. In fact in some quarters of the year we are profitable." Clearly, BMS is content being a sizeable fish in a smaller pond  rather than in a sea of red.

Why political jousting in Arunachal Pradesh is worrisome
On Monday the Supreme Court will hear the petition of the  Congress party challenging the Centre's imposition of President's rule in Arunachal Pradesh, one of the five Congress-ruled states in  Northeast (NE) India that have been on the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP's) radar since the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Both the assembly and Lok Sabha elections were held simultaneously, although there was a lot of cross-voting. Result:  voters gave a clear majority to the Congress in the assembly polls (42 out of 60 seats, which later increased to 47) but the BJP's vote share in the Lok Sabha segments was significantly higher at 47.8% against Congress' 43.7%.  On the night of Republic Day, the state assembly was once again up for grabs courtesy of the President's approval of a Cabinet recommendation to impose Central rule in Arunachal and keep the legislative assembly in suspended animation. The Cabinet reckoned this had to be done because of a "constitutional breakdown" in the state, as reported by the state's governor Jyoti Prasad Rajkhowa.  For the Congress, the way ahead is simple:  parade 31 MLAs as it claims it still has, provided of course the apex court offers it that option on Monday. That may not be easy, considering that 21 Congress MLAs have 'rebelled'; and five-time MLA Kalikho Pul, the leader of the pack, has a shot at becoming chief minister with the support of the 11  BJP MLAs. The stage may indeed be set for a repeat of 2003 when the BJP briefly ruled  Arunachal Pradesh with the help of Congress defectors.  Strategic Importance Arunachal Pradesh may be located in India's easternmost part, too far flung from the nation's collective conscience to figure in drawing room conversations in Lutyens' Delhi or in the politically hyperactive cow belt of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. But as far as the BJP and Congress are concerned, aside from the four big states that go to polls in a couple of months (West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam and Kerala), Arunachal perhaps today is of the most strategic importance.  For starters, as neighbouring Assam, the largest  NE state in terms of population, is scheduled to go for polls in April, the BJP's bid to net Arunachal is loaded with political implication. Though it will clearly be a backdoor entry, if BJP succeeds in conquering Itanagar, the message emanating from the Capital will be clearcut: that the saffron part has dislodged one "corrupt" government in the region, and Assam is next in line.  "The governor (Rajkhowa) was appointed with the sole purpose of destabilising and dislodging my government. He converted Raj Bhawan into the state BJP's political headquarters," alleges Nabam Tuki, chief minister of Arunachal till President's rule was imposed. Commenting on the governor's report where it was alleged that a Mithun (a bovine) was slaughtered outside the Raj Bhawan to intimidate the governor, Tuki said: "Yes, there was Mithun slaughter, but it was done at the residence of an ex-BJP MLA. Lies were spread through social media.  Also, where is the question of threatening the governor? No one can even throw a stone at the Raj Bhawan which is guarded by Central forces," Tuki adds, dismissing the law and order problems as cited in the governor's report. He also denies his linkage to underground Naga group, the National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Khaplang (NSCN-K), as underlined in the governor's report, leaked to a section of the media though the apex court wanted the report in a sealed envelope.  BJP's national spokesman Sudhanshu Trivedi counters that Arunachal witnessed a constitutional breakdown, forcing the Centre to take the route of President's rule. "As many as 34 MLAs (out of 60) were in favour of dislodging the government. The Congress did not have the numbers and that's why it could not convene the assembly session," he says. As many as 11 BJP MLAs and two independents lent support to the 21 rebel Congress MLAs, making it a total of 34 MLAs who opposed the Tuki government.  Amid the political tug of war, rebellion and potential for horse-trading, New Delhi can't ignore one harsh reality: Arunachal Pradesh borders three of India's neighbours  Bhutan, China and Myanmar, stretching up to 1,630 km. And this NE state is more important than many others because China has been persistently staking claim over its entire 83,743 sq km territory even after 53 years of India-China war when the Chinese soldiers briefly occupied parts of its land.  Residents in Walong, located in extreme east of India, where brave soldiers of the Kumaon Battalion fought in 1962, can't erase the memories of that war. "The 1962 war still haunts us. But we are cent percent Indians and we don't want to be secondclass citizens of China," Chaitom, an elder in Mechong village of Changwinti circle said, when this correspondent visited the area in November 2014.  Also, Arunachal is the only pre-Sikkim Northeast state that has not witnessed home-grown insurgency (Sikkim was merged into India in 1975), although Naga underground outfits, particularly the NSCN-K have been active in Tirap, Changlang and Longding districts, the area adjoining Nagaland. Most Arunachali youth were never attracted to insurgency despite the Northeast region being a hotbed of militancy.  Thus, the risk of the youth of Arunachal, who are till date patriots to the core, going astray against a backdrop of political turbulence is a risk that can never be underplayed. And it's not rocket science to understand that China, which claims Arunachal as its own, will find opportunity in the insecurity.

Over $150 bn required for smart cities: Study
 MUMBAI: The Modi government's vision of creating 100  smart cities will require an investment of over USD 150 billion over the next few years with private sector being a significant contributor, says a report.  According to Deloitte, nearly USD 120 billion will come from the private sector.  The  government has already initiated two programmes with an initial outlay of USD 7.513 billion for 'Smart Cities Mission' and the 'Atal Mission for Rejuvenation of Urban Transformation (AMRUT)' for the upgradation of 500 existing cities.  "Even as funding for these smart cities is an area of concern, the major challenges remain with respect to the development of smart cities project management, government decision making and policy and regulatory framework,"  Deloitte India Senior Director PN Sudarshan said.  The government recently announced the list of first 20 cities to be developed as 'smart cities' with Bhubaneswar topping the list followed by Pune, Jaipur, Surat, Kochi, Ahmedabad, Jabalpur, Vishakapatnam, Sholapur, Davangere, Indore, New Delhi, Coimbatore, Kakinada, Belagavi, Udaipur, Guwahati, Chennai, Ludhiana and Bhopal.  While several cities have made incremental investments in smart solutions, the challenge will be to replicate these on a larger scale, he said.  According to the study, in 2016, service providers and over-the-top content providers will  invest heavily in city- wide Wi-Fi networks which will be the back-bone for smart city services.  "As smart solutions are heavily dependent on ICT, service providers will play a significant role in smart cities.  In 2016, service providers will participate in (and lead in many cases) consortiums for responding to RFPs for smart/ digital solutions for various city and state governments," Sudarshan said.  Reliance Jio is likely to roll out Wi-Fi services across over 50 cities in 2016.  Similarly, Bharti and Vodafone are deploying Wi-Fi through a joint venture company, Firefly.  Facebook is working with BSNL to deploy Wi-Fi in 100 areas in rural India, while  Google has announced a partnership with the railways to provide hotspots in 400 railway stations by 2016.  "Over the next 10-15 years, these cities will emerge as key technology, economic, and social hubs for the country.  We believe that service providers that expect to be serious players in smart cities will take a center-forward position in leading consortiums in the development of smart cities," he added.

JD(U) exploring alliance with RLD, Congress in UP
 NEW DELHI: JD(U) and RLD are exploring the possibility of an umbrella alliance with Congress and some smaller parties in Uttar Pradesh for the 2017 Assembly elections after the JD(U)-RJD-Congress coalition inflicted a humiliating defeat on BJP-led NDA in the  Bihar polls.  Sources said RLD chief  Ajit Singh had a meeting with JD(U) President Sharad Yadav a couple of days back during which the two leaders discussed the broad contours of a larger coalition against the BJP at a time when both SP and BSP, the two major parties in the state, have ruled out forging any alliance.  The RLD chief had also discussed the issue with Bihar Chief Minister  Nitish Kumar in Delhi last month when the latter was here for the launch of Yadav's autobiography.  Peace Party chief Ayub Ansari had also met Nitish Kumar and JD(U) general secretary K C Tyagi to discuss the issue, sources said. Peace Party has its presence in Eastern UP, mainly in areas around Gorakhpur.  Some clarity on such an alliance is likely to emerge in a day or two after JD(U)'s state executive meeting in Lucknow today, they said.  Tyagi, a senior party leader from Uttar Pradesh who has been assigned the task of organizing a joint rally of the RLD and JD(U) in western Uttar Pradesh said, "We are keen to be part of any anti-BJP campaign or front.  "In any such campaign in western Uttar Pradesh, RLD is an important element. Any grand alliance minus RLD will not be successful in Western UP," he said.  When asked whether the party is in talks with RLD on the issue of an alliance in Uttar Pradesh, Tyagi said, "We keep talking to RLD leaders. Nitishji and Sharadji have spoken to the RLD leadership".  Sources in JD(U) said the party was also keen on forging an alliance with Congress in  Assam, but the latter's state unit was not inclined.  Janata Dal had 22 MPs in Uttar Pradesh in 1991, when Mulayam Singh Yadav and Chandra Shekhar parted ways with V P Singh and formed Samajwadi Janata Party.  Since then Janata Dal and later Janata Dal (United) have been on decline there. In 1996, the party headed by Sharad Yadav had 6 MLAs, which came down to two in 2002 Assembly polls.  Buoyed by the victory in Bihar, the party feels it can rejuvenate its moribund unit in Uttar Pradesh in alliance with parties like RLD and Congress.  JD(U), which is running a coalition government with RJD in Bihar, is hopeful that Lalu Prasad will campaign for the secular umbrella alliance, if it comes about, despite SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav being his relative.  The SP chief had walked out of the JD(U)-RJD-Congress alliance in Bihar and formed a third front to contest the polls.

How America did a cover job on India and Pakistan
India has been a source of endless fascination for American journalists and writers going back to Thoreau and Twain in the 19th century. In fact, newspaper editors of the time would have stumbled on to rich pickings if they had dispatched someone to cover events in India  a country that was forever in ferment during the early years of Indian nationalism.  As it turned out, it wasn't till the 1920s, when magazines began to boom in America, that attention turned towards personalities from India with a concentrated cover-page focus. It is Rabindranath Tagore who holds the honour of being the first Indian to grace the cover of an American magazine; he featured on the cover page of The Mentor magazine in May 1921 with his story, The Woman. Tagore had travelled through America thrice by then, and his 1913 Nobel for literature had made him a familiar figure in literary circles by the 1920s.  In 1929, Mahatma Gandhi became the first Indian to grace the cover of Time magazine, which itself was founded in 1923. Gandhi made three Time covers in all: the first in 1929 when Time featured a drawing of him looking rather fiendish despite a caption that said "Saint Gandhi". The next one a year later sees a kinder, gentler-looking Gandhi, while a third Gandhi cover came in 1947, shortly before India's independence.  Time did not put Gandhi on the cover after his assassination in 1948 (as it did with both Indira Gandhi in 1984 and Rajiv Gandhi in 1991), probably because January 30 was too close to the deadline for its February 2, 1948 issue. But Newsweek, founded in 1930, did put Gandhi on the cover on February 9, 1948, with the very trite caption, "After Gandhi, What?" The February 2 Time cover is of Barbara Ann Scott, a Canadian figure skater who won a gold at the Winter Olympics. The February 9 Time has the story on Gandhi's death but no cover mention; the astronomer Hubble is on the cover.  Gandhi's political heir Jawaharlal Nehru was a Time favourite, making the cover of the magazine six times between 1942 and 1964, the most by anyone from the subcontinent before or since. In between, Time also featured assorted Indian political personages on cover, including Subhas Chandra Bose, Vallabhbhai Patel, and Acharya Vinoba Bhave. The odd man out: the Nizam of Hyderabad, who featured on the Time cover of February 22, 1937 as the 'Richest Man in the World'  the Bill Gates of that era.    Quite notably, Pakistan's founder Mohammed Ali Jinnah did not make the cover of Time, although he made the cover of Life magazine, as did Gandhi. In fact, few Pakistanis have made the cover of western magazines: apparently, they do so only when they wage war or inflict terrorism. Both Ayub Khan and Yahya Khan, perpetrators of war in 1965 and 1971, featured on the cover, not solo but along with Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi respectively.  Pakistan as a country has made the Time cover several times but always in a poor, negative light: Why the US is stuck with Pakistan (May 23, 2011), Pakistan's Despair (Sept 20, 2010), and Pakistan's Dark Heart (January 16, 2012) are some of the more recent chronicles of bad news.  Benazir Bhutto did make Time and Newsweek cover several times, but by then the magazine had Asian editions (Newsweek even has a Pakistan edition now) so she was jettisoned from the main US cover page. In fact, one of the Bhutto covers put her in a negative light, asking if she had stolen billions or was being smeared. Similarly, Pervez Musharraf did make Time cover in 2002 but only in the Asian edition. Ditto Nawaz Sharif, Asif Ali Zardari, and Imran Khan.

J&K stalemate: PDP, BJP alliance on tenterhooks
